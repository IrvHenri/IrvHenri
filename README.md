<h3 align= "center">A self-taught Frontend engineer looking to get better everyday! Currently based out of Montreal. Also a ramen enthusiast.</h3>

- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a cook at Montreal's premier ramen restaurant - Yokato Yokobai - for almost 3 years. I wouldn't trade that experience for anything because it taught me the value of teamwork, discipline and focus. Irasshaimase!
