# 👋 Hi, I'm Irving
**Full-Stack / Salesforce + AWS + Angular**  
I build reliable, secure systems for the Gov of Canada and beyond. Previously at a startup; now shipping integrations, APIs, and modern UIs that actually move the needle.

**Notable wins**
- Scaled a parliamentary scheduling platform to **345+ offices**, supporting **~1,000+ weekly service hours**.  
- Built a Salesforce–AWS case management module that **reduced case-processing time by ~30%**.  
- Delivered a **secure Salesforce↔AWS data pipeline** via **AppFlow** with **Lambda · SQS/DLQ**; streamed **Salesforce Platform Events → CloudWatch** to power analytics, strengthening **data governance** and **incident visibility**.

- Current focus: secure Salesforce↔AWS integrations, delviering MVPs and CI/CD.  
- Off-hours: ramen, tennis, learning by doing.

**Toolbox:** JS/TS · React/Angular · Node · AWS · Salesforce · PostgreSQL · Terraform · CI/CD
