# 👋 Hey, I'm Irving

Full-stack dev working with **Salesforce, AWS, and Angular**.  
Right now I build tools and integrations for the Government of Canada.

## A few wins
- Helped scale a scheduling platform used by **345+ offices** and **~1,000 weekly service hours**.  
- Built a Salesforce–AWS case system that **made handling cases noticeably faster**.  
- Set up a **secure Salesforce ↔ AWS data pipeline** so the team can actually see what’s going on in production.

## Outside of code
Ramen, tennis, and learning by trying things out.
